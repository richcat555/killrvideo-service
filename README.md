# KillrVideo – Python Backend (FastAPI + Astra DB)

## Assessment Notes

I completed this assignment independently and implemented the KillrVideo Python backend using FastAPI and Astra DB.

All required functionality was completed:
- Astra DB connection using astrapy
- Environment configuration via `.env`
- Data loading and querying
- REST API endpoints
- GitHub repository setup and CI workflow

The official workshop reference repository  
https://github.com/aar0np/kv-be-python-fastapi-dataapi-table/tree/workshop  
was not accessible to me (404 / permission denied), so I was unable to clone the workshop branch.

Despite this, I completed the assignment independently by:
- Following the workshop instructions
- Using public KillrVideo schema/data references
- Implementing the backend logic without copying from the reference repo

This repository contains my full working solution.
